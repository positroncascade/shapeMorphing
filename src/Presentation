  Basic capabilities: 
    - Can generate structured meshes for NACA 4,5 and 6 series (at the moment) for OpenFOAM software in ONE CLICK!
    - Fast setup OpenFOAM case avaliable! 
      (after some options you can get OpenFOAM running over your foil without codding, copy directories, etc..)
    - Plots residuals and forces over the airfoil.

  Further capabilities:
    - Foil Shape manipulation; you can easily transform your foil and test it through some control points. Very fun. 
    - Optimization: CMeshFoil transform (I'm working on this...)
