 CMESHFOIL AT WORK...

    What about some testing? :)

    OFcase is a test OpenFOAM case dir, it only has a case skeleton.
    OFcase/constant/polyMesh is aumatically removed by CMeshFoil, and a new blockMeshDict will be created there.
    CMeshFoil runs "blockMesh" and "checkMesh", if everything is OK it goes with paraFoam!

    NACA 0012, easy...
